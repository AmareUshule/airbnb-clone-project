# airbnb-clone-project
## üß≠ Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb.  
It allows users to **book stays, list properties, and manage reservations** through an intuitive and responsive interface.

This project replicates key features of Airbnb to demonstrate practical skills in modern web development ‚Äî from front-end UI/UX to secure backend and database management.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Build a **fully functional** Airbnb-style application.
- Implement **user authentication** (sign up, login, logout).
- Enable **property listings** with images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Support **booking and reservation management**.
- Provide a **modern, responsive UI** optimized for all devices.
- Practice **full-stack development principles** using a real-world use case.

## üë• Team Roles

In this project, each team member has a specific role to ensure smooth development and collaboration:

- **Frontend Developer**: Responsible for designing and implementing the user interface, ensuring the application is visually appealing and responsive across devices.

- **Backend Developer**: Handles server-side logic, API creation, authentication, and integration with the database to ensure secure and efficient data management.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Manages the database, including schema design, queries, and optimization to ensure data integrity and performance.

- **Full-Stack Developer**: Works on both front-end and back-end, bridging the gap between UI design and server-side logic.

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the team, sets deadlines, ensures requirements are met, and manages communication between team members.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) / Tester**: Tests the application for bugs, usability issues, and ensures the project meets the defined standards before deployment.

- **DevOps / Deployment Engineer**: Handles deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and server infrastructure to make sure the application runs smoothly in production.

   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `password`
   - `date_joined`
   - **Relationship:** A user can have multiple properties and bookings.

2. **Properties**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title`
   - `description`
   - `price_per_night`
   - `owner_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
   - **Relationship:** Each property belongs to one user (owner) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

3. **Bookings**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)
   - `start_date`
   - `end_date`
   - **Relationship:** A booking belongs to one user and one property.

4. **Reviews**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
   - `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)
