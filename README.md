# airbnb-clone-project
## 🧭 Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb.  
It allows users to **book stays, list properties, and manage reservations** through an intuitive and responsive interface.

This project replicates key features of Airbnb to demonstrate practical skills in modern web development — from front-end UI/UX to secure backend and database management.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a **fully functional** Airbnb-style application.
- Implement **user authentication** (sign up, login, logout).
- Enable **property listings** with images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Support **booking and reservation management**.
- Provide a **modern, responsive UI** optimized for all devices.
- Practice **full-stack development principles** using a real-world use case.
